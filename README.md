# Disclaimer

This configuration is made from lazyvim, because I was to lazy to config by my self, however, I made some basic changes, currently we are not using tokyonight, but yes catppuchin (I think is the name not sure), any issue regarding to the configuration, it might because how the plugins are being loaded, fill free to make any issue

to install is quick:

```
git clone git@github.com:PedroVMota/nvim_config.git ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
```

This is how you installed, so it's quick do not worry 
```
```
```
